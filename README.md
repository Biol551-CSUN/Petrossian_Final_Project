# Petrossian Final Project
### Created by: Cynthia Petrossian

This project uses data from my in-progress thesis. This [data](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Data) was obtained using CellProfiler and was used to create the [outputs](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Outputs) in this repository. 

This project investigates the morphological effects of master regulator genetic targets on the intestinal stem cells of *Drosophila melanogaster*. I focus on the overexpression of the target Indy (Indy OE). My data analysis shows that the overexpression of Indy results in an increae of enteroendrocrine cells relative to progenitor cells, as well as an increase in distances between enterocytes in one Indy OE line. 

The folder of this repository are as follows:  
[Data](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Data)  
- [20117](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Data/20117) contains spreadsheets with distance data for the Indy OE cross 20117 and respective Control. A data dictionary is also included. 
- [21412](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Data/21412) contains spreadsheets with distance data for the Indy OE cross 20117 and respective Control. A data dictionary is also included.  
- [EE_Progenitor_Counts](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Data/EE_Progenitor_Counts) contains a spreadsheet with EE and Progenitor counts for Indy OE and respective Control. A data dictionary is also included. 

[Images](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Images) contains the images used in my presentation that are not outputs.  

[Outputs](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Outputs) contains all of the outputs from my code. There are 7 images and 3 gifs.  

[Scripts](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Petrossian_Final_Project/tree/main/Final_Project/Scripts) contains my script for this project, as well as the html document.
